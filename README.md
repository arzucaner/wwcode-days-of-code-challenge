# wwcode-days-of-code-challenge

## This project is part of the Coding Days Contest organized by Women Who Code, which includes a total of 70 days of challenges.
The Challenge was held twice for 30 days and once for 10 days, and I earned a total of three badges.
Throughout the competition, I created several projects and learned new programming languages and frameworks, including Redux, Bootstrap 4, Alpine.js, Advanced React, Firebase App, ul design, CSS animation, and JavaScript. 
This project is a great example of the skills and knowledge gained through the Coding Days Challenge and showcases the versatility of the various languages and frameworks used.
I believe that this challenge has helped me improve my coding skills significantly.
